###### GETTING AND CLEANING DATA (COURSE 3- JUNE 2020) #####
Files:
* run_analysi.R
* train_test.csv
* average.csv
* CodeBook.md

Description:

The  "run_analysis.R" script contains the code for Course Project of "Getting and Cleaning Data" (week 4) from the Data Science Specialty course from JHU. 
The R script uses data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (source: Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012)

The R script does the following:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

"train_test.csv" is the tidy dataset with the mean and standard deviations for each measurement (step 4)
"average.csv" is the tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (step 5).
"CodeBook.md" is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and the transformations erformed to clean up the data.
